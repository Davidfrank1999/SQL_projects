# Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 1
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the language for communicating with a relational database.

I have created a Bash script that uses SQL to enter information about your computer science students into PostgreSQL.

Files included
    - insert_data.sh ( used to enter information)
    - students.sql
    - stufdent_info.sh (used to retrive information) 

Data
    - courses.csv
    - students.csv
